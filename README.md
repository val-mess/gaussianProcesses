# markovAndGaussianProcesses
These are my projects for the course Markov And Gaussian Processes For Modeling which is a last year course of engineering taught by Ms Helbert at Ecole Centrale Lyon. 

You will find 4 projects in R :
1. Simple Kriging
2. Estimation of the parameter theta by empirical variogram, cross validation and macimum of likelihood
3. Bayesian Kriging
4. Experimental designs (Latin hypercube sampling, Low-discrepancy sequence) - Sensitivity analysis (Sobol indices) - Optimization and inversion
